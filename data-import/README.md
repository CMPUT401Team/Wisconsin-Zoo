Importing data
==============

**Work in progress**

Import "carnivorecoexistence_10-07-2012.sql" (frome the science team) into "carnivore_coexistence".

Import "subjects.sql".

The images are divided into seasons, the script runs on one season at a time:

```
./import path/to/S1
```

Now there are records in the "zooniverse_subjects" table.
