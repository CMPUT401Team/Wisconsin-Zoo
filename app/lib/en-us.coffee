    s1:
      title: "Welcome!"
      content: "Welcome to Wildlife Watch! In this project, we are asking you to identify animals found in camera trap photos from around Wisconsin. Your help allows us to better understand how animal populations across the state change through time."
    s2:
      title: "Identifying animals"
      content: "You are presented with a set of photos on the left and a list of potential animals on the right. When you spot an animal within a photo, simply click the corresponding animal on the right. You will be asked to supply some followup info, such as the number of animals found in the images."
    s3:
      title: "Filtering by characteristics"
      content: "Occasionally it is difficult to determine which animal is in the photo. Just above the list of animals is a variety of methods to filter the animal list. Selecting different options reduces the number of choices, making your job easier."
    s4:
      title: "Made a mistake?"
      content: "If you need to delete any of your existing marks while viewing an image, simply find your animal in the list below the image and click the 'X' icon. Don’t worry if you’re unsure about your choices, though—even a guess is more helpful than nothing!"
    s5:
      title: "That's it!"
      content: "You may catch up on project updates through speaking with other volunteers via Talk."

      <h2>Understanding wildlife populations</h2>
      <p>Forests are home to dozens of native mammals, hundreds of other vertebrate species, and thousands of invertebrates and native plant species, living together in diverse natural communities. WildlifeWatch is a collaborative effort to utilize camera traps, also known as trail cameras, to learn about the distribution and trends of our wildlife populations.</p>
    '''

    whyWeNeedYou: '''
      <h2>Why we need you</h2>
      <p>Over the course of a month, a single camera might take thousands of photographs. You help to make all these photographs meaningful by classifying the type and number of animals in the image. Because we know where and when these photographs were taken, we can create maps for both common and rare species across the state and visualize how animal populations change through time. From black bears to badgers, see what critters you can spot roaming the Wisconsin forests! Share your favorites and join the discussion about what you are observing along the way. We will share with you what we are learning back here at Zooniverse.</p>

      <h2>Citizen science in the classroom</h2>
      <p>Wildlife Watch is a great opportunity to integrate science and technology in the classroom and a unique way for students to learn about wildlife and their habitats.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.zooteach.org">ZooTeach</a> is a companion website to Zooniverse where educators can find and share educational resources relating to WildlifeWatch and the other Zooniverse citizen science projects. WildlifeWatch is a recent addition to Zooniverse, so if you have any ideas for how to use the project in the classroom, please share your lesson ideas or resources on ZooTeach.</p>

      <p>There are a number of excellent wildlife education resources available online. A few of our favorites are below:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/eek/">http://dnr.wi.gov/eek/</a> - Environmental Education for Kids! (EEK!) is an electronic magazine for kids in grades 4-8 published by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. It includes information on Wisconsin’s wildlife and resources for educators on how to help students use EEK!</li>
        <li><a href="http://projectwild.org/">http://projectwild.org/</a> - Project WILD is a nationwide program that provides resources for educators in teaching about wildlife and their habitat. The materials are available through Project WILD workshops lead by certified instructors. The Project WILD handbook includes more than 165 hands-on activities for PreK-12.</li>
