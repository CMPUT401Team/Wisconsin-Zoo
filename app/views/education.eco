        <h2>Citizen science in the classroom</h2>
        <p>Snapshot Wisconsin is a great opportunity to integrate science and technology in the classroom and a unique way for students to learn about wildlife and their habitats. In addition to participating online, teachers in Wisconsin can also host a camera in their school forest or other property. For more information see dnr.wi.gov, keyword Snapshot Wisconsin. </p>

        <p><a href="http://www.zooteach.org/">ZooTeach</a> is a companion website to Zooniverse where educators can find and share educational resources relating to Snapshot Wisconsin and the other Zooniverse citizen science projects. Snapshot Wisconsin is a recent addition to Zooniverse, so if you have any ideas for how to use the project in the classroom, please share your lesson ideas or resources on ZooTeach.</p>

        <p>There are a number of excellent wildlife education resources available online. A few of our favorites are below:</p>
